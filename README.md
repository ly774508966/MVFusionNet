# Implementation of MVFusionNet on Torch #

The framework is trained and tested on ShapeNetCore55 for 3D shape recognition and retrieval. It consists of two networks, a ResNet for deep feature extraction and a Fusion Network which fuses the extracted deep features with hand-crafted one.

## Dataset ##
The framework is trained and evaluated on ShapeNetCore55 benchmark

## Dependencies ##
* cunn `code(luarocks install cunn)`
* cudnn `code(luarocks install cudnn)`
* Download ResNet (resnet-18 used) to the diretory Network1/models/resnet

## Run ##
