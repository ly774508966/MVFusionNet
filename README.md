# Implementation of MVFusinNet for Large-scale 3D shape retrieval on Torch
The framework is trained and tested on ShapeNetCore55 for 3D shape recognition and retrieval. It consists of two networks, a ResNet for deep feature extraction and a Fusion Network which fuses the extracted deep features with hand-crafted one.

#Dataset
